INTRODUCTION:
One serious road accident in India occurs every minute and 16 lose their life every hour. One common reason for road accidents is the driver either being drowsy or under the influence of alcohol. This project introduces a system which detects a driver is drowsy or drunk and raises an alarm to warn him, and thus reduce the risk of an accident.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Using opencv, the live feed of the driver is obtained through the webcam and the face is detected using dlib's face detector.
